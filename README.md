# **THE CLASSIC GAME OF TIC TAC TOE**

### ***The game of the ages that has lasted the test of time. Play on, shine on!***
 
## **How To Play**

This is a game that has lived through the aeons and has been shared by many cultures around the world. To play, simply sign up and sign in, and decide who starts. This is a two-player game. Who starts the game will be player X, and the second player, player O. The game will alternate between players each turn. The first player to get three boxes in a row wins.

## **Initial Planning and Development**

In beginning of this project, I started off with a very simple wireframe sketch which doesn't look like much, but it was what all that followed sprung from. In future developments, I aim to use more detail as it would have helped in the process. The original wireframe sketch can be found [here](https://i.imgur.com/TYB4OWK.jpg).

### **User Stories:**

#### ***As a user, I want to be able to:***
* sign up with my email address so that I have an account and can come back and play again.
* sign into my account to play the game
* start a new game upon signing in or finishing
* know who wins or if game is a draw 
* sign out when I am done playing
